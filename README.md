In my Print Development journey, I explored diverse themes and art styles to create three unique and meaningful designs.

The first design, “Marigold and Green Leaves,” was inspired by the themes Tropical Festive Bloom and Monsoon in Bloom. I began by researching various floral print styles and then hand-sketched marigold flowers and green leaves, reflecting flat vector art with folk and Scandinavian botanical influences. After selecting a vibrant and fabric-appropriate color palette, I developed a repeating floral pattern and visualized it on a white kurta using mock-up tools. This allowed me to see how the print would translate onto actual apparel, bringing my tropical, festive concept to life.

The second print, titled “Colorful Fruits & Vegetables Icons,” focused on the idea of Fresh Produce and Healthy Living. Drawing from kitchen décor and pop art styles, I illustrated various fruits and vegetables in a cartoonish, whimsical way. Through detailed research and careful color selection, I arranged these icons in a balanced layout and applied the design to both plain cloth and tablecloth mock-ups, perfectly aligning the print for functional, home-inspired textiles.

My third creation, “Engineered by Caffeine,” is a personal tribute to my cultural roots in Pattachitra art. Combining tradition with modern tech culture, I hand-sketched a character working on a laptop while sipping tea—symbolizing creativity powered by caffeine. The design used bold outlines, floral borders, and flat earthy colors typical of Pattachitra. I then employed AI tools to digitally enhance and stylize the sketch while preserving its cultural essence. The final artwork was applied to a coffee mug, successfully blending heritage with contemporary lifestyle in a unique and expressive way.
